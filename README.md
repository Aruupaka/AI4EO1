<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is part of the GEOL0069 course, specifically designed for the fourth week's assignment. It focuses on the practical application of unsupervised learning techniques in Earth Observation (EO). The core of the project lies in its innovative approach to analyzing and interpreting EO data, using advanced machine learning algorithms.
